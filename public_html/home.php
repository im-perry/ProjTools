                <p style="padding-bottom: 20px; padding-top: 20px;">Ford Motor Company, commonly known as Ford, is an American multinational 
                    automaker that has its main headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb 
                    of Detroit. It was founded by Henry Ford and incorporated on June 16, 
                    1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the 
                    Ford brand, and most luxury cars under the Lincoln brand. Ford also owns 
                    Brazilian SUV manufacturer Troller, an 8% stake in Aston Martin of the 
                    United Kingdom and a 32% stake in Jiangling Motors. It also has 
                    joint-ventures in China (Changan Ford), Taiwan (Ford Lio Ho), 
                    Thailand (AutoAlliance Thailand), Turkey (Ford Otosan), and 
                    Russia (Ford Sollers). The company is listed on the New York Stock 
                    Exchange and is controlled by the Ford family; they have minority 
                    ownership but the majority of the voting power.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale 
                    management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing 
                    sequences typified by moving assembly lines; by 1914, these methods were known 
                    around the world as Fordism. Ford's former UK subsidiaries Jaguar and Land Rover, 
                    acquired in 1989 and 2000 respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker Tata 
                    Motors in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker Volvo from 1999 to 2010. 
                    In 2011, Ford discontinued the Mercury brand, under which it had marketed 
                    entry-level luxury cars in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle 
                    East since 1938.</p>

                <p style="padding-bottom: 20px;">Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind General Motors) 
                    and the fifth-largest in the world (behind Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai-Kia 
                    and General Motors) based on 2015 vehicle production. At the end of 2010, 
                    Ford was the fifth largest automaker in Europe. The company went 
                    public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special Class B shares, 
                    still retain 40 percent voting rights. During the financial 
                    crisis at the beginning of the 21st century, it struggled financially, 
                    but it has since returned to profitability. Ford was the 
                    eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018 Fortune 
                    500 list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion. 
                    In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles[14] and employed 
                    about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.</p>
